AKOP (Angular Kit Of Parts) is intended to be a set of directives and other useful bits that can be selectively
integrated into your angular projects.

## Directives

### MultiSelect

MultiSelect provides the familiar file-system style hotkey selection strategy. See [demo/multi-select.html](https://github.com/jamesBrennan/akop/blob/master/demo/multi-select.html) for a
basic implementation.
